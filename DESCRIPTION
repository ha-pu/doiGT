Description: Google offers public access to global search volumes through its search engine through
  the Google Trends portal. The globaltrends package downloads search volumes provided by Google Trends
  and uses them to measure and analyze the distribution of search trends across countries or within
  countries. globaltrends allows researchers and analysts to investigate patterns within these trends,
  such as degree of internationalization of firms and organizations or dissemination of political,
  social, or technological trends across the globe or within single countries.
