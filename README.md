- initialize database -> at current working directory
  - create empty database
  - create empty tables

    - dbWriteTable(conn = gtrends_db, name = "data_wrld", value = data, append = TRUE)
    - delete data from columns
    - dbExecute(conn = gtrends_db, statement = "DELETE FROM data_map WHERE batch_c=0")
    - set indizes for tables
    - tmp <- dbSendQuery(gtrends_db, "CREATE INDEX id_con ON data_con (geo, batch);")
    - dbClearResult(tmp)
  - enter example data
    - data_geo -> lst_wdi (with wdi package) and lst_us (from gtrends)
    - batch_terms -> example data (from gtrends doc?)
    - batch_time -> set to "2010-01-01 2019-12-31"
    - dict_obj -> example based on batch_terms
- all code refers to current working directory
- functions to import data
  - data_geo
  - batch_terms
  - batch_time
  - data.frame(keyword = c(...), time = "2010-01-01 2019-12-31", type = "control|object")
  - dict_obj
- functions to delete data
  - entire batch
  - link to data_map, data_score, data_agg
  - dbExecute(conn = gtrends_db, statement = "DELETE FROM data_map WHERE batch_c=0 AND batch_=0")
