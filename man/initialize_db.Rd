\usage{
initialize_db()
}
\value{
Database is created.
}
\description{
The function creates a new database for the \code{globaltrends} package and
creates all necessary tables within the database.
}
\details{
The function creates a new SQLite database for the \code{globaltrends}
package. The database is saved as "db/globaltrends_db.sqlite" in the working
directory. If the folder "db" does not exists in the working directory, the
folder is created. If the database already exists in the working directory,
the database is deleted and re-created. Within the database all tables are
created and the default location sets are added to the respective table:
\itemize{
  \item *countries* - all countries with a share in global GDP >= 0.1% in 2018
  \item *us_states* - all US federal states and Washington DC
}
After creating the database, the function disconnects from the database.
